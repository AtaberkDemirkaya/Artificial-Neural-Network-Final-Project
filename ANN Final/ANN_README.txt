myData.xlsx file is my excel data file.

In order to run the code properly, you must initialize the path to the excel file properly.
The path must be defined wherever you hold the data file.
My case it was the file I created on my desktop.

Rest of the code is pretty straightforward, as long as the path is defined correctly it should work.
If there are any questions that may boggle you, please feel free to check my report.
